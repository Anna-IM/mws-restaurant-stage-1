## *Restaurant Reviews App*

### Project Overview:

For the **Restaurant Reviews** project, I took a static design and converted it to be responsive on different sized displays. The app should be accessible for screen reader use. I've also added a service worker to begin the process of creating an offline experience.

### Task

I've been provided with a code for a restaurant reviews website. The code should have a lot of issues. It’s barely usable on a desktop browser and almost not usable on mobile devices. It also doesn’t include any standard accessibility features, and it doesn’t work offline. My job was to update the code in order to fix these issues while still maintaining the included functionality.

### How to open the project in a browser?


1. In a terminal, check the Python's version you have: `python -V`. If you have Python 2.x, spin up the server with `python -m SimpleHTTPServer 8000` (or some other port, if port 8000 is already in use.) For Python 3.x, you can use `python3 -m http.server 8000`. If you don't have Python installed, navigate to Python's [website](https://www.python.org/) to download and install the software.

2. With the server running, visit the site: `http://localhost:8000`
